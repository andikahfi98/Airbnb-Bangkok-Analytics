# Background
The Songkran Festival, known as the Thai New Year, is a celebration lasting three days or more and is one of the most important traditions in the country. The festival took place from April 13 to 15, 2023, with some celebrations extending up to a week. It is famous for water splashing activities, symbolizing purification, washing away bad luck, and welcoming the new year with joy. Songkran also involves religious rituals, such as paying respects to ancestors and visiting temples for prayers.

During the festival, Bangkok becomes the main center of activity, with several districts as the core festival areas, including Bang Rak, Pathum Wan, and Phra Nakhon. Thousands of people gather in these areas to participate in water fights, cultural parades, art performances, and other entertainment events happening on the city streets.

Airbnb is committed to supporting travelers who want to experience the uniqueness of Songkran by providing quality and comfortable accommodations. To attract more visitors and ensure they have the best stay experience, Airbnb will provide listing recommendations during the festival, especially in the central celebration districts.

# Objectives
1. Segment Airbnb listings based on grades.  
2. Identify appropriate marketing strategies to maximize profit after segmentation.  
3. Develop strategies to improve the quality of low-grade listings.

# Conclusion

1. **Accommodation Preferences**:  
   - The majority of international tourists, estimated at around 300,000, are assumed to prefer **Private Rooms** and **Hotel Rooms**. This is because festival-goers typically travel alone, as couples, or in small groups of fewer than five people. Therefore, larger accommodations like **Entire Home/Apt** are less popular.

2. **Segmentation**:  
   - Properties in the higher price range tend to receive higher grades (A or B), while more affordable listings mostly fall into lower grades. Keywords in the segmentation help differentiate the quality of each listing.

3. **Listing Quality**:  
   - Many listings in the central festival districts have low grades, indicating that a large portion of accommodations are not yet adequate for tourists. Preferences for Grade A accommodations are very limited, showing that the market for high-quality properties in these three districts is still restricted.

Thus, accommodation management during the Songkran Festival should consider tourist preferences as well as the quality of available listings to enhance visitor experiences and support Bangkokâ€™s tourism industry.

# Recommendations to Increase Company Profit

### Business Team

1. **Quality Improvement Programs:**  
   - Develop training and support programs for hosts to enhance the quality of their properties, including facilities, aesthetics, and customer service.

2. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**  
   - Create marketing campaigns segmented by listing grade. Tailor messaging and channels to target customers according to their preferences, such as via social media, email marketing, or online ads.

3. **Bundled Offers:**  
   - Create packages that combine accommodations with additional services, such as local tours, airport pickup, or vehicle rentals, to generate additional revenue.

4. **Programs for Low-Grade Hosts:**  
   - Offer subscription-based programs to hosts who successfully improve their listing quality and achieve higher grades, for example through higher search ranking or more prominent placement on the platform.
